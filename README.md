# Digipaali device and interface

Digipaali (2018-2020) is a public-funded project conducted by HÃ¤me University of Applied Sciences, and Natural Resources Institute Finland, in cooperation with Finnish innovative farms. The project aims to improve the efficiency of silage bale life-cycle management. This repository includes programs receiving and processing data from Arduino/Wemos board, and sending bales' data to IoT Hub. The code also hosts a local web application to control the device and display real-time measurements. 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Prerequisites

* [NodeJS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Data collecting device](https://github.com/tqbao98/digipaali-arduino.git)

## Installing

Clone the repo or download zip file and extract it, in your desire folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/tqbao98/digipaali-device.git
```

Install potentially required packages:

```
npm install
```
## Editing files to fit your setup

* In ```index.js```, edit path to static files. By default, it is './public', which should work in most cases, but sometimes full path is required, e.g:

```
app.use(express.static('/home/pi/digipaali-device/public'));
```

* In ```index.js```, change url to your MQTT broker, e.g:
```
var client  = mqtt.connect('http://localhost:1883')
```

* For Google map to work on web application, [create a Map Javascript API credential](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and paste the key to ```/public/index.html``` file:

```
src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR-API-KEY&callback=initMap">
```

## Running

To run the program, in repository folder:

```
node index.js
```

Optionally, you can run the project with [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) or [pm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) for better project management.<br/> <br/>
To run on nodemon, first install it:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

then: 

```
nodemon index.js
```

To run on pm2, first install it:

```
npm install pm2 -g
```

then: 

```
pm2 index.js
```
